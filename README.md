# PDF Gen

This is a simple C program that uses some simple libraries to generate some pdf files for me.

The files that can be generated are :

- Business offers
- Order confirmation
- Invoices

## Compiling

To compile the program simply run the following command in the root directory :

```shell
make
```

This will compile all the necessary files into an executable called *pdf_gen*.
